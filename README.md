# Machine-Learning
simple machine learning algorithms in Python

using the ``pygame`` library for screenplay and the ``tensorflow`` library for calculation

prequisite: 

- ``Python 3.xx`` on ``64x``
- all libraries:  ``tensorflow``, 
                  ``opencv-python``,
                  ``numpy``
                  
- understanding of neural-network-layer
- how to play pong
                  
start:

- the machine learning algorithm starts with the ``deep_q_algo.py`` 
- in ``deep_q_algo.py`` the ``OBSERVE`` variable, determines the visible runtime of the algo

Note:

- the application is RAM heavy, cause of each frame has to be cached for learning
